# Reflection Questions

## Question 1

I started with the top error first (dmv), but I was having a hard time with it, so I moved on to a different error to see if that would be easier. I then moved to facility, which was easier to debug. Then I just go through each error message and try to solve them individually before moving on to the next one. 

## Question 2

It is hard to familiarize myself with the code because I didn't write it. The debugging at least gave me a starting point to begin reading it. I also saw concepts that were unfamiliar, so it was hard to find a starting point. 

## Question 3

I think what made it easier was knowing the structure and having some familiarity of how it should be layed out. This also allowed me to search out and find the errors easier than I thought it would be. I think getting more familiar with different coding styles and different techniques will make it easier to start reading someone else's code.
